# **Meeting Rooms II**

Given an array of meeting time interval objects consisting of start and end times `[[start_1,end_1],[start_2,end_2],...] (start_i < end_i)`, find the minimum number of rooms required to schedule all meetings without any conflicts.

**Note:** `(0,8),(8,10)` is **NOT** considered a conflict at 8.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [(0,40),(5,10),(15,20)]

Output: 2
```

Explanation: room1: `(0,40)` room2: `(5,10),(15,20)`

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [(4,9)]

Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- $0 <= intervals.length <= 500$
- $0 <= intervals[i].start < intervals[i].end <= 1,000,000$

### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(nlogn) time and O(n) space, where n is the size of the input array.


### Hint 1

Try to visualize the meetings as line segments on a number line representing start and end times. The number of rooms required is the maximum number of overlapping meetings at any point on the number line. Can you think of a way to determine this efficiently?


### Hint 2

We create two arrays, start and end, containing the start and end times of all meetings, respectively. After sorting both arrays, we use a two-pointer based approach. How do you implement this?


### Hint 3

We use two pointers, s and e, for the start and end arrays, respectively. We also maintain a variable count to track the current number of active meetings. At each iteration, we increment s while the start time is less than the current end time and increase count, as these meetings must begin before the earliest ongoing meeting ends.


### Hint 4

Then, we increment e and decrement count as a meeting has ended. At each step, we update the result with the maximum value of active meetings stored in count.
